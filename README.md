## once

Once is an art project made by S. Merlin based on idea of R.Smirnov.  
It is a social media and messenger with clear limits:

- You can send only one message a day to each person
- You can post only in your profile and only once a week  
  The project is aimed at pointing out issues we face being involved in  
  modern post-internet way of communication, such as:
- Anxiety and lack of concentration caused by  
  endless flow of information
- Constant need for "something new" in your device which is  
  a bad habit and a waste of time
- "Quality" of thoughts is replaced by quantity
- The limiteless ability to upload information into the web leads to  
  increasing of CO<sub>2</sub> emission and an increase in the land occupied by huge data centers
